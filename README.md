This was a group project coded in assembly language for the DE2Bot robot at Georgia Tech

Our idea was to make the robot draw a circle, triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, and n-sided polygon using various subroutines and an inverse lookup table

It was completed in a time crunch and modified at the time of presentation as needed to properly demo the program

It is in no way meant to be good code, but was a fun exercise in assembly language
